        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p><b>Persona 5 Royal</b> has a plot that feels like a cross between Inception and a superhero story, placing you in the role of Joker, a quiet high school student who has become a victim of circumstance. While walking home from school one day, you witness a woman being assaulted by a man and intervene. The man is accidentally injured and sues you for damages, which results in you being given a criminal conviction, expelled from school, and sent into the city to attend Shujin Academy. Not long after you arrive at Shujin, you gain the ability to access “The Metaverse”, an alternate plane of existence born out of people's cognition. Within the Metaverse are Palaces — bizarre dungeons based upon the twisted way that certain people in power view real locations and people. For example, the first Palace is a castle ruled by Kamoshida, a physically and sexually abusive volleyball coach who sees Shujin Academy and its students as things to use as he pleases.</p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p><b>Elden Ring</b> is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling.  As a result, it is very different from other open-world games I have played such as Skyrim and Far Cry which are story and questline driven. From the get-go, Elden Ring doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. You can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses, it truly is up to you with no outside influence. It is truly refreshing to feel this sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open world game.</p>

            <p><b>Elden Ring</b> has also mastered the art of sublety. For example, for a game like Skyrim, there are various elements such as the character dialogues, leveling system, various landmarks that I could clearly point to in contributing to the game's success. However, this is not the same with <b>Elden Ring</b>. It's hard to place my finger on one specific thing that makes the game so enjoyable. Many times I've gone in to play this game for half an hour, only to become immersed, losing track of time and playing for hours on end. I belive that it's each of the game's features: its combat system, transportation, landscape, lore, storytelling, etc. that complement each other in a way that none of them are overbearing and at the same time, come together in such a fluid manner that I as the player can't notice it and am drawn into a level of immersion that I haven't felt from any game before.</p>
            
            <p>Other, more objective factors of Elden Ring are equally as impressive--it's hard to believe this is a $60 game. The map is massive, far bigger than I could've ever imagined, with more content packed into it than any other world game I've played before. I have not had a single moment where I've felt the map felt desolate or empty, there was always something to see and explore. The combat system is rich, balanced, and rewards each playstyle. The difficulty of the game is refreshing and I feel that I'm being challenged to improve and innovate as I play the game instead of relying on old hacks. The subtle details, such as changes in behavior over time of day or cross-NPC interactions add a layer of immersion that makes the world feel alive. It is also a very polished product: while games today are released with game-breaking bugs and issues, I haven't encountered a single bug in <b>Elden Ring</b> even given its massive map aside from minor visual glitches. It is truly astounding how much that adds to the immersion of the game.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, I feel that <b>Elden Ring</b> is an amazing game. While it isn't perfect by any means, in fact, the imperfections of the game give me something to look forward to for what will be the sequel to this, it will be hard to find a game from the last decade that is as immersive as this. I am truly impressed by From Software's work and I look forward to their next game. Elden Ring will inspire the next generation's set of games and I hope to see what comes from this. I've thoroughly enjoyed playing Elden Ring and I hope to see you too enjoy it.</p>

        <!-- REVIEW -->
        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>Retro throwbacks rarely go for the mid-'90s mix of 2D sprites and low-res 3D models, but along comes <b>Octopath Traveler</b>, a game that manages to both faithfully recreate the aesthetic and add to it in subtle yet meaningful ways. It's a great look, one that draws you into the world and delights you with small artistic touches that bring something magical to otherwise simple environments. Enemies and bosses alike are lavishly drawn despite the confines of the game's intentional low-res aesthetic. It's a similar treatment that you can find in a game like Final Fantasy VI, where rough sprites in the overworld transform into big, detailed illustrations in battle.</p>

        <p>Taking pleasure in the dreamy, diorama-esque look of Octopath will satisfy you for a while, as will the immediately likable combat system, which implements a few small innovations to revitalize the otherwise traditional turn-based mechanics. What may ultimately trip you up, however, is the narrative--a collection of eight short stories each divided up into four chapters of increasingly higher difficulty. After picking a protagonist at the start of the game, you gather allies by travelling to their icons on a map.</p>
